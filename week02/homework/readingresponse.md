Before start designing, you should really figure out what product you
are trying to design and what problem you are trying to solve. Don't just
think about your design but draw it out so you can actually see it on paper
to see if it will flow as you wish. Show it to other people in your team 
and get their feedback before you start to design. find handy tools that 
you like to use during your design process. Know what audience you are
designing for and know what they acutally want.
