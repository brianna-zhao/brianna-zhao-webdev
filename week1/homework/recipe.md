<h2>Steps!</h2> --heading 2 
<!--ordered list-->
1. In a large bowl, Whisk sugar, salt, and butter togather
 until a paste forms with no lumps.
2.Whisk in the egg and vanilla, beating until light ribbons 
fall off the whisk and remain for a short while before 
falling back into the mixture
3.Sift in the flour and baking soda, then fold the mixture 
with a spatula (Be careful not to overmix, which would 
cause the gluten in the flour to toughen resulting in 
cakier cookies).
4.Fold in the chocolate chunks, then chill the dough for 
at least 30 minutes. For a more intense toffee-like flavor 
and deeper color, chill the dough overnight. The longer 
the dough rests, the more complex its flavor will be.
5.Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C). Line a baking sheet 
with parchment paper.
6.Scoop the dough with an ice-cream scoop onto a parchment
 paper-lined baking sheet, leaving at least 4 inches (10 cm)
  of space between cookies and 2 inches (5 cm) of space from 
  the edges of the pan so that the cookies can spread evenly.
7.Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the edges have started to barely brown.
8.Cool completely before serving.
