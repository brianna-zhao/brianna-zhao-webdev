         <h1>BACKGROUND</h1>
         <p>"My Little Pony" is a media franchise developed by Hasbro, initially introduced in 1981 as a toy line targeted primarily at young girls. The brand's success quickly expanded beyond toys into an extensive media presence, including several animated television series, movies, merchandise, and a broad fan community that spans various age groups and demographics.</p>
         <p>The original toy line was launched with ponies that had colorful bodies, manes, and unique symbols called "cutie marks" on their flanks, each pony representing a different personality trait or kind of magic. This concept of individuality and the magical nature of the ponies became central themes as the franchise evolved.</p>
         <p>The first animated series aired in 1984, titled "My Little Pony," which was mainly designed to promote the toy line. However, it was the 2010 reboot, "My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic," created by Lauren Faust, that significantly transformed the franchise's popularity and cultural impact. This series introduced more complex characters, intricate storytelling, and themes that resonated with not only children but adults as well, leading to the emergence of a dedicated fanbase known as "bronies" among others.</p>
         <p>The success of "Friendship Is Magic" has led to numerous spin-offs, including the "Equestria Girls" series, where the main characters are reimagined as humans in a high school setting, further movies, and a plethora of merchandise.</p>
