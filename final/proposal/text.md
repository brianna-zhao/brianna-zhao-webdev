continue on the  theme of my midterm project but use bootstrap tp change the whole
layout of the page
changes and stuffï¼š
    1. change the home page layout to image carosoul/flip card*
    2. use bootstrap function to change the whole layout of my individual pages
        1.'container' and 'container-fluid' because basically everything on my page now are absolute positioned or fixed. use this to make it more respnsive and not look weird when changing screen size*
        2.'navbar' my navigation bar(the unordered list inside the unordered list) now are fixed positioned and it looks kinda funky and not aligned, use bootstrap to change and costumize it to make it look more desiged and well planned out but still fit into my theme*
        3.also the navbar for phone sized screen because it looks really distracting and weridly positioned. change it to an icon and you can only see the list item when click on it(click the icon and expand)*
        4.add new page: a little answers couple question and estimate what is your character in MY LITTLE PONY using 'form' 'input' and 'button' function and use 'alert' to pop-up a "you are (this character)" page*
        5.add another new page using 'form' 'input' and 'button' function dropdown menu and if user answers all of the question right use 'alert' to pop-up a picture of my dog as reward
        6. costumize bootstrap css tp make it fit in my theme*
        7. if has tome change relationship page and add some interactive funtion to that page-javascript
    3. since im planning on using bootstrap i might just abandon my old css page, the positionsing isn't wokingthat well so redo the css for the erbsite*
