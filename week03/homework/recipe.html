            <li>1 1/4 all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>

        <h2>Steps!</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, Whisk sugar, salt, and butter togather
                until a paste forms with no lumps.</li>
            <li>Whisk in the egg and vanilla, beating until light ribbons 
                fall off the whisk and remain for a short while before 
                falling back into the mixture.</li>
            <li>Sift in the flour and baking soda, then fold the mixture 
                with a spatula (Be careful not to overmix, which would 
                cause the gluten in the flour to toughen resulting in 
                cakier cookies).</li>
            <li>Fold in the chocolate chunks, then chill the dough for 
                at least 30 minutes. For a more intense toffee-like flavor 
                and deeper color, chill the dough overnight. The longer 
                the dough rests, the more complex its flavor will be.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C). Line a baking sheet 
                with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Scoop the dough with an ice-cream scoop onto a parchment
                paper-lined baking sheet, leaving at least 4 inches (10 cm)
                 of space between cookies and 2 inches (5 cm) of space from 
                 the edges of the pan so that the cookies can spread evenly.</li>
            <li>Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the edges have started to barely brown.</li>
            <li>Cool completely before serving.</li>
        </ol>
